# Our github workflow:
This can change if there's a better way to do things, but just to establish some organization.


# After cloning this repo:
  When adding a new feature, create a new branch for it (git checkout -b "new branch name") and work in that branch (git checkout "branch you created").
    If it's ready to be added to the overall project, push the branch and submit a pull request (third tab above) to merge your branch with the "main" branch.
  
# For frontend:
  Navigate to the frontend directory (CSCI_201_Final_Project\front-end) and run "npm install" to get all the libraries the React project needs to run.
  
  "npm start" to start the dev server
  
  Install any new frontend libraries you need in the frontend directory.
